# Compliance AI

**Compliance AI** is a system for automating compliance monitoring, proof gathering, and reporting.  
Instead of relying on manual audits, Compliance AI continuously checks activities against regulations and provides real-time alerts, evidence, and reports.

## 🌐 What It Does

- Automatically ingests compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, company policies).
- Converts requirements into **machine-readable rules**.
- Continuously monitors applications, APIs, logs, and cloud services.
- Detects compliance violations in real-time.
- Collects tamper-proof proof for audits.
- Generates reports for auditors and stakeholders.

## ⚙️ Core Workflow

1. **Rule Ingestion**  
   - Collect laws, policies, and standards.  
   - Translate into policies, conditions, and constraints.  
   - Example: *User data must be encrypted before storage.*

2. **System Integration**  
   - Connect to data sources: applications, APIs, logs, cloud services.  
   - Deploy lightweight agents or hooks to capture events.

3. **Monitoring & Detection**  
   - Continuously track activity (e.g., data access, transactions, file storage).  
   - Use log parsers and event listeners.  
   - Compare events against compliance rules.

4. **Violation Detection**  
   - If a rule is broken, flag as a compliance violation.  
   - AI classifies severity (low, medium, high risk).  
   - Automatically capture contextual data.

5. **Proof Gathering**  
   - Capture log snapshots.  
   - Store network traces or API call details.  
   - Save system states/configurations.  
   - Generate hash-based, tamper-proof evidence.

6. **Evidence Storage**  
   - Secure vault with encryption.  
   - Timestamp and digitally sign each proof.  
   - Ensures **auditability** and **immutability**.

7. **Reporting & Alerts**  
   - Real-time alerts for violations.  
   - Dashboards for auditors and compliance officers.  
   - Export automated compliance reports (PDF, JSON, Excel).
